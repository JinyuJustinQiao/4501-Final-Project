# 4501-Final-Project

Project Discription: The project is dedicated to the study of the relationship between hired trips, hired trips location and weather. Our first step was to clean up the yellow taxi, Uber and weather data. We entered the cleaned data into the database via sqlalchemy in the second step. In the third step we wrote several queries to get the information we wanted to learn. In the fourth step, we visualized the data and got more information.
